# PlantManager_Endpoint

This code is designed for Arduino nano and pro mini to take measurements from soil and control waterpumps to irrigate plants and able to grow in an automated way. The project contains PCB design as well, currently it is design to use 12V for supply the board and the waterpumps as well. It can control up to 8 waterpumps and 8 soil moisture detectors to individually control water supply for the plant. It is designed to consume as little electricity as possible because the system switches to deeplsleep mode when nothing to do.
